fix(turbopack): unify class name generation between CLI and Babel plugin

Fixes critical class name mismatch when using Turbopack with Babel. Previously:
- CLI generated counter-based atomic names (`.a0`, `.a1`)
- Babel plugin generated readable names (`silk_position_relative_h65s`)

Now both use deterministic hash-based class names:
- Production: `s{hash}` (e.g., `s1ehecwq`)
- Development: `silk-{hash}` (e.g., `silk-1ehecwq`)

Changes:
- Unified hash function to murmurHash2 in both CLI and Babel plugin
- Unified input format: `property-value-variant`
- Unified output format: `s{hash}` for production (no separator, shorter)
- CLI now uses `shortClassNames: false` for deterministic hash-based names
- Babel plugin simplified production format from digit mapping to `s{hash}`

This ensures CSS generated by CLI matches class names inserted by Babel plugin during compilation.
